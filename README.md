I worked on a simple project during my spare time. It's a straightforward application that determines whether any alphanumeric string can form a combination resulting in the number 7, humorously referred to as "Thalafied."

## Custom HTML Tag (Work in Progress)

I'm also working on creating a custom HTML tag for incorporation into other websites. Please note that the code is a work in progress and may look a bit messy.
